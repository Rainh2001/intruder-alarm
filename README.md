School Project - Intruder Alarm 

| The Intruder Alarm System was created during the design process of four ideas.
  1. Manipulating the use of the PIR Motion Sensor and LED lighting.
  2. Incorporating control of the alarm by implementing a Push Button.
  3. Incorporating sound by implementing a Passive Buzzer.
  4. Incorporating a password for the system by implementing a Keypad.

These four designs are all paired with their own personal files of code.
Ensure to discuss and evaluate each design, defining their features and what is
good or bad, as well as interesting.

Ensure to implement pictures and video URLs from my YouTube channel 'Rain Holloway'.
